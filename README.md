# Purpose

 * This project is meant for demonstrating what I have learnt in web development in the 19 days before this read me's release.
 including :
    - Simple API for adding items to the database using code-first DB context.
    - Lux-Themed website.
    - Usage of Jquery to color the pages according to the assitant you are viewing from the about section.
    - Custom wallpapers designed by me for each core ( Including the wallpaper seen above ).
 
# Languages used
 
  1) C# Asp.net MVC and Web API.
  2) Html5.
  3) Css.
  4) Jquery.
  5) Bootstrap (Lux theme from bootswatch.com ).
  6) Code-first migrations for Database.
  
# Content of this site
  
  - This web project aims to advertise for the assistant bundle and implement simple features like money assistant's wallet
  system and Notes assistant's simple notes taking, also a simple Jquery scripts for the website's colors in some pages
  to match each assistant's main color.
  
# Notes

  - The project will not contain AI features like "integrating multiple cores at the same time" for a while because I am still
  learning how to do so, so until further notice, this website will serve as advertising website for the assistant.
